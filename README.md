# ILIAS - ASQ - Assessment Question Service

The ILIAS ASQ is designed as a component that offers services around assessment questions. The way other components can interact with ASQ is as easy and flexible as possible. The ASQ provides a complete authoring and scoring environment for assessment questions.

The ASQ provides no higher level business logic. Those must be handled by the consumer. E.g. the business logic that a single question can only be answered once or the business logic for handling a group of questions so that questions can only have a single answer.
